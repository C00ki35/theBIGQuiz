## BIG Quiz

I used ReactJS and basic CSS to create this 2 player game. Each player has 10 seconds to answer the question in their chosen topic. The Open Trivia API is used to fetch questions, the number of questions, as well as the topic is selected by the users at the start of the game. 

Please note:
The display is not responsive and is best viewed on larger screens.

### `GETTING STARTED`

To test the application locally:

- git clone https://github.com/C00ki35/theBIGQuiz.git

The hosted version of the game can be found here:
